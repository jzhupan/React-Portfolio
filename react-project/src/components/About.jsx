      <p>
        After several years in freelance illustration and graphic design, I
        boldly ventured into programming, choosing front-end development as my
        specialization. Initially, I anticipated a seamless transition; however,
        it unfolded into a challenging yet exhilarating journey of growth and
        learning. This shift necessitated leaving my comfort zone and embarking
        on a resolute path forward. As part of this new commitment, I've
        established a routine of making daily commits on GitHub. This practice
        is not just about submitting substantial code for projects; it's about
        consistently engaging in my development work, showcasing my dedication
        to continual improvement. Moreover, I'm continually striving to enhance
        my front-end designs. By blending my skills in illustration and graphic
        design, I aim to create interfaces that are not only visually striking
        but also functional and user-friendly. Each step in this journey refines
        my technical skills and reaffirms my passion and commitment to evolving
        as a developer.
